          <li> Drivers of Attitudes toward Asian Americans: Disentangling Stereotyping from Racial Identity (with Jieun Park and <a class="page-link" href="https://www.jessicahjlee.com/home">Jesscia Hyeonjeong Lee</a>)</li>
            <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            Despite substantial research on attitudes toward Asian Americans, we know less about the underlying motivations. Prior studies have demonstrated that individuals make inferences about other characteristics based on someone’s race, hence feelings toward Asian Americans could be a consequence of the correlation between race and other perceived traits. To what extent are attitudes toward Asian Americans driven by dislike for racial outgroup per se, xenophobia, fear of group competition, or other presumed stereotypes? Leveraging original survey experiments that manipulate race signaled by name, immigration status, perceived threats, and stereotyped traits in short vignettes, we aim to disentangle the effects of race and other related traits inferred from it on interpersonal attitudes. Distinguishing among these competing motivations is crucial not only for understanding how perceptions of Asian Americans are shaped but also for understanding the disparate implications of interracial relationships. This study will shed light on what is the principal driver of interpersonal affect regarding race.

          <li> Unraveling Climate Refugee-Specific Hostility: Exploring Deservingness Bias in Developed Countries (with Jieun Park)</li>
            <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            Climate-induced migration is a pressing global issue, with millions projected to be displaced. Understanding public attitudes towards climate refugees is crucial but lacks research focus, often treating refugees as a homogeneous group. This study investigates attitudes towards climate and war refugees, focusing on the underlying factors driving climate refugee-specific hostility. Introducing the concept of deservingness bias, we argue that climate refugee-specific hostility may stem from the suspicion that those fleeing from natural disasters and climate change are not genuine asylum seekers but economic migrants in disguise. This suspicion is notably pronounced in developed economies: people who are more suspicious about the motives of climate refugees support less climate-induced refugees than war-induced ones in developed economies, but not in other countries. We posit that the presence of well-established systems for addressing domestically displaced populations fosters skepticism regarding the motives of climate refugees, potentially leading to biased attitudes. Drawing on data from original survey experiments and Ipsos Survey 2022, this research aims to gain insights into factors shaping attitudes towards climate and war refugees, with a particular focus on deservingness bias. Our findings contribute to comprehending the group-specific attitudes hypothesis and public attitudes toward refugees in a broader context. It also informs policies to promote integration and reduce tensions in the face of climate-driven displacement.

          <li> Inference at the data’s edge: Gaussian processes for modeling and inference under model-dependency, poor overlap, and extrapolation (with <a class="page-link" href="https://www.chadhazlett.com/">Chad Hazlett</a> and Doeun Kim)</li>
            <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            The Gaussian Process (GP) combines a highly flexible approach to non-linear regression with rigorous handling of uncertainty estimation. A key feature of this modeling tool is that it's uncertainty estimates reflect additional uncertainty due to model-dependence in regressions where data are sparser, or in models extending beyond the edge of the data. We offer an accessible explanation of GPs, and provide an implementation more suitable to social science inference problems, which reduces the number of user-chosen hyperparameters from three to one or zero depending on context. GPs can be most valuable where conventional approaches have poor properties due to model-dependency/extrapolation. Accordingly, we demonstrate the usefulness of GPs in contexts where two models (e.g. for the treated and control) have poor overlap; or where they have no overlap (e.g. regression discontinuity and interrupted time-series designs).

            <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            When studying inequality, a focal outcome may not exist for some individuals. Those who are not employed have no hourly wage, for example. Scholars of wage inequality routinely drop the non-employed. But the same causal process that shapes wage inequality among the employed also shapes which people are employed at all. Researchers who drop those with non-existent outcomes inadvertently induce selection problems and obscure inequality. We show how to use principal stratification methods to study two quantities: (1) the average effect on whether an outcome exists, and (2) the average effect on that outcome among the latent set of people who would have an outcome under either treatment condition. Our technical contribution is to carry out principal stratification within a parametric regression analysis that adjusts for measured confounders. Our applied contribution is to reveal how standard practices in sociology and economics obscure inequality. We illustrate by showing how past work has understated the causal effect of motherhood on the hourly wages of women who would be employed with or without children.
